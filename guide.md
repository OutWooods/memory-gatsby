A good basic rule, is, how many facts does this reall contain? Is the question simple?

## Doing it

Keep your pile in numerical order. Easy to find cards. Put them in a box. Ideally in a visible place, as a) its good to have a fixed place where you always do your memory b) it's a visible reminder of a job you need to do.

If you want a bit of motivation, maybe write a reminder why you're doing this in the box. Or a little calender with crosses for each day you complete.

After completing a day, say well done to yourself. More just a sense of pride. Occasionally look at your calendar and remind yourself how pleased you are with what you've done. Or watch as the cards mount up.

Very occasionally, try doing all your cards, this is nice as a way to see how far you've come. Also it's good to do a full overview of the topic.

Be strict, don't 'let' yourself off if you get close, this will mean you reinforce innaccurate answers which will be harder to undo in the future. Remember, there's literally no reason to cheat - you're doing this for yourself.

Pause a card and come back to it later in the day - or after doing a few more cards.

Keep to the limits of cards added, at the start it can be easy to rush in. But consistenty doing this over 30 days is more valuable than doing lots over a week. The cards will mount up, and making sure you are solid on 10 is better than being iffy on 30.

Pick one day, which is your big review day - I do Sundays. This will be when you'll do alot of your long term cards. The weeks will be more new/harder cards.

If you can, do it in the morning, and then a review of wrong one's in the evening. The second time for wrong answers isn't necessary, but you'll find it'll help those tricky cards to stick more.

Effort, don't instantly dismiss a card. Put some time into trying to remember. Push yourself. Pause. Come back to it. The act and effort behind remebering will help you in the longer term, you'll surprise yourself over what you remember and it's really satisfying when you. Forgetting is part of memory. You will forget bits, but consistency of practise will make this less, and less often.

As you do it, do look at a card, and remember when you find it really hard, and one day, you'll remember it well.

Keep cards in numerical order, piles of 30 is best. If you want, you can keep a wrong pile, as all wrong cards from today will reappear tomorrow. And it's not bad to look through them a second time.
