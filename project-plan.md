## Add Text

[x] Store a text in local storage.

[x] Add text to local storage (which then breaks it down into sections of 10).

[] Refreshes when you upload new text (probably best to just have separate pages tbh)

## Quiz

[] Pick a level of difficulty.

[] At first only show 10 words.

[] Click to reveal the word, then mark as right or wrong.

[] If you get a particular word wrong, it will come up again in the next 2 quizzes.

## Algorithm

[] Once you reach level 3, on all sections, (and get them all right), you get the next set of words.

[] Each time you get it right, it goes up a level for that section.

[] Can only do it once an hour.

## Levels

1 - 20% of words missing
2 - 30%
3 - 50%
4 - 75%
5 - 90%
6 - 100%


## Longer term

1 - voice detection?
2 - clumping words together
3 - bias to longer words
