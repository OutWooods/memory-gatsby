## Add Text

[x] Store a text in local storage.

[x] Add text to local storage (which then breaks it down into sections of 10).

[x] Refreshes when you upload new text (probably best to just have separate pages tbh)

## Quiz

[] At first only show 10 words.

[] Click to reveal the word, then mark as right or wrong.

[] If you get a particular word wrong, it will come up again in the next 2 quizzes.

## Algorithm

[] Once you reach level 3, on all sections, (and get them all right), you get the next set of words.

[] Each time you get it right, it goes up a level for that section.

[] Can only do it once an hour.

What this means
a) Get all the sections which are 3 or above (and the one after)
b) Each level apply the hiding on the relevant percentage
c) Click to reveal and then, tick or cross as is relevant
d) if all are right in a section,

## Levels

1 - 20% of words missing
2 - 30%
3 - 50%
4 - 75%
5 - 90%
6 - 100%


## Longer term

1 - voice detection?
2 - clumping words together
3 - bias to longer words
